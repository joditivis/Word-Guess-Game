# About:
University of Denver Coding Boot Camp third week assignment: This assigmnet required us to create a Word Guess Game using JavaScript.

# How to Play:
```
- New York City Theme and Category: What are some common places or things New York City is known for?

- Guess the correct word before you run out of guesses to recieve a win point for that round!

- If you run out of guesses before completing the word, a loss point is added for that round.

- Try to get more wins than losses!

- When you see a " - " in the current word, it is representing a space

- Listen to a little tune while you play!
```
